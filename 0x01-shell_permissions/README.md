My name is Betty

I am going to be working on the shell permissions for this program.

I will be assigning different permission leveles for every users, this includes file owner, group owner, and everyone else. 



The different permission levels I may be assigning will be 

chmod:  To modify file access rights or change the permissions of a file or directory

su:To become a temporarily superuser

sudo:To grant more than one superuser privileges as needed

chown:To change file ownership

chgrp:To change a file's group ownership
